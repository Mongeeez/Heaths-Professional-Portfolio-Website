            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Heath Lanmon, a 15-year-old aspiring software developer with a passion for learning and community service. Over the past year, I had the incredible opportunity to be a part of the Air Force Junior ROTC (AFJROTC). This experience has taught me valuable leadership skills, discipline, and the importance of teamwork.
                In addition to my time in AFJROTC, I have dedicated numerous hours to the California Highway Patrol (CHP) Explorer Program. Through this program, I've had the chance to help out with various community events and proudly embody the role of their mascot, Chipper, whenever needed(I also got to make a custom decal in Rocket League for the CHP:). These experiences have not only strengthened my sense of community but also allowed me to give back in meaningful ways.
                Looking ahead, I am thrilled to share that in the summer of 2025, I will be attending the Aim High Flight Academy offered by the Air Force. This exciting opportunity will allow me to learn how to fly planes and further explore my passion for aviation.
                Combining my technical skills with my dedication to service and leadership, I am eager to continue growing and making a positive impact both in my community and in the field of technology.

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>
                I've worked on several exciting projects that showcase my skills and creativity. One of my favorite projects is the personal portfolio website you’re currently viewing. Building this website allowed me to utilize my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and user-friendly design.
                Another interesting project I worked on was developing a game in Godot for the California Highway Patrol (CHP). Inspired by the classic Dino Runner game, I created a version featuring their mascot, Chipper. This project involved game design, programming, and incorporating the mascot into a fun and engaging game. It was a fantastic experience that not only honed my game development skills but also allowed me to contribute to a meaningful project for the community.
                Feel free to check out my GitHub profile for more details on these and other projects I've worked on. I'm always exploring new ideas and expanding my skills through various projects.

            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>
                I'm pretty good at C++, HTML, and CSS. I can build websites and apps with these skills, creating both the structure and the style of web pages. I'm also experienced in coding using the .NET framework(and Godot, a game making software), which helps me develop efficient and scalable applications. Additionally, I've worked on various projects that required integrating different technologies, which has improved my problem-solving skills.
                Aside from coding, I'm a big fan of gaming. Playing Call of Duty has sharpened my quick thinking and strategic planning abilities. These skills are surprisingly useful when debugging code or coming up with creative solutions to programming challenges.
                Overall, my mix of technical knowledge and gaming experience makes me a versatile and adaptable developer, always ready to tackle new challenges and learn new things.
